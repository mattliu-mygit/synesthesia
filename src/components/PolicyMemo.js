          <b>Summary</b>
          <p>
            Current research on synesthesia has largely focused on the creation
            of a standardized way of identifying and classifying synesthetes.
            However, current approaches do not account for the breadth of
            individual and cultural differences amongst synesthetes.
            Specifically within chromesthesia, research has largely failed to
            account for idiosyncrasies within synesthetes. Researchers have also
            adopted an overly aggressive focus on Western Classical Music in
            their research. We propose two major reforms to existing research
            methods when studying chromesthesia: (1) Broaden testing batteries
            to allow for the idiosyncratic nature of synesthetes (2) Diversify
            the professions and cultures of test subjects to better account for
            environmental differences.

          <b>Introduction:</b>
          <p>
            Research on synesthesia has long ignored the breadth of individual
            and cultural differences amongst synesthetes. Specifically within
            chromesthesia, research has largely failed to account for
            idiosyncrasies within synesthetes. Researchers have also adopted an
            overly aggressive focus on Western Classical Music in their
            research. We propose two major reforms to existing research methods
            when studying chromesthesia: (1) Broaden testing batteries to allow
            for the idiosyncratic nature of synesthetes (2) Diversify the
            professions and cultures of test subjects to better account for
            environmental differences.

          <b>Background:</b>
          <p>
            Synesthesia describes a rare neurological phenomenon in which a
            specific stimulus, which may be sensory, like a sound or flavor, or
            cognitive, such as a word or number, arouses a non-externally
            stimulated sensation. For example, an individual with chromesthesia
            might see the color red every time they hear the musical note C#.
            One important characteristic that distinguishes synesthesia from
            associations, is that the synesthetic pairing of two stimuli is
            involuntary, automatic, non-suppressible. Additionally, synesthetic
            pairings are highly consistent throughout the synesthete’s lifespan,
            and remain unchanged from early childhood. Most interestingly,
            synesthesia is idiosyncratic, meaning that it manifests itself in a
            unique way for each person that has it. For example, while Person 1
            may see the letter A in red, Person 2 might always see the letter A
            in yellow instead. Many other distinctions between synesthetes have
            been made, where there has been estimated that there are anywhere
            from 65 to over 150 different forms of synesthesia. For example, it
            has also been found that synesthetes can be classified by higher and
            lower order synesthetes. The distinction between higher and lower
            synaesthetes was first proposed by Ramachandran and Hubbard in 2001,
            based on evidence of cross-activation mechanisms operating at
            different times and in different locations in the brain. Lower
            synesthetes process the inducing information and generate the
            concurrent at an early stage in cortical processing, specifically in
            the fusiform areas that deal with form and colour perception. In
            contrast, so-called higher synesthetes utilize later areas that
            manage the conceptual aspects of color. An additional classification
            of synesthetes includes associator vs. projector synesthetes. For
            associator synaesthetes, the synesthetic effects occurring
            concurrent to the stimulus occurs within “their mind’s eye,"" so to
            speak, meaning that it is internally-perceived by the synesthete.
            Projector synesthetes experience the concurrent outside of their
            mind as a physical sensation. In other words, they “project” the
            concurrent into external space, hence the name. Only recently has a
            more standardized battery of tests for synesthesia been developed,
            and these are only for the most common types-- grapheme-colour, or
            associating letters and numbers with color; and sound-color or
            chromesthesia, when a musical stimulus such as a tone elicits a
            color sensation. Most of these tests present the letter or tone
            stimulus and have participants use a color wheel to describe the
            evoked sensation, and then the reflex speed and consistency of the
            responses over multiple tests is examined. The idea behind testing
            the speed of the response is that if the evoked sensation is truly
            involuntary, the participant will be quicker at selecting a color
            than if they needed to actually think and consciously make the
            association. These tests, and generally tests done on synesthetes,
            have been done in large part with western music music.

          <b>Supporting Arguments/Analysis:</b>
          <p>
            In order to study this expansive phenomenon that is synesthesia, we
            can not restrict ourselves to simply grapheme-based and sound-based
            testing. As there are so many types of synesthetes with each type
            being idiosyncratic in nature, there is a very current need for
            developing tests for the other forms of synesthesia. These include
            types such as lexical-gustatory synesthesia, where spoken and
            written language produces a taste or smell, mirror-touch
            synesthesia, where a touch on one side of the body provokes a
            sensation on the other side of the body, amongst others. Although
            these all vary in condition, a similarity in all of them include a
            reaction from a stimulus. As such, we can use the current
            grapheme/sound-based standardized test battery method of timing
            responses to stimuli to help determine whether a reaction to a
            stimulus is natural or artificial. Unlike the current test battery,
            participants would not be determining colors they see and the
            stimulus would not be strictly visual or auditory, but would vary
            based on the type of synesthesia described by the participant. This
            would not only allow us to test for other types of synesthesia, but
            accommodate for higher vs. lower and association vs. projection
            synesthetes where synesthetes from opposite groups have varying
            responses to tests. Thus, we propose a more generalized strategy of
            determining synesthetes, where the defined stimulus and response
            types are general in nature, but validation of responses is strict.
            We would thus be opening up testing to the many other forms of
            synesthesia as well as accommodating synesthesia’s idiosyncratic
            nature while being relatively confident that the participant isn’t
            faking reactions. Specifically regarding Chromesthesia and other
            sound-based synesthesia, the vast majority of current tests utilize
            Western music in testing.
