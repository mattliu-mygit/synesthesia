          <b>Summary</b>
          <p>
            Current research on synesthesia has largely focused on the creation
            of a standardized way of identifying and classifying synesthetes.
            However, current approaches do not account for the breadth of
            individual and cultural differences amongst synesthetes. Researchers
            have also adopted an overly aggressive focus on western classical
            music in their research. We propose two major reforms to existing
            research methods when studying chromesthesia: (1) broaden testing
            batteries to allow for the idiosyncratic nature of synesthetes, and
            (2) diversify the professions and cultures of test subjects to
            better account for environmental differences.
          </p>
          <b>Introduction:</b>
          <p>
            Research on synesthesia has long ignored the many individual and
            cultural differences amongst synesthetes. Current research methods
            place an overemphasis on grapheme and sound-based testing methods
            when identifying synesthesia. This precludes the recognition of many
            other forms of synesthesia within the standard battery of tests.
            Additionally, even within the types of synesthesia that do fall
            within the standard color and sound test battery, there are issues
            of culture and learning effects that are not resolved. From our
            sample of interviewees, it appears that training in western
            classical music has an effect on the color-sound pairings observed
            in chromesthesia. This suggests a learning effect that cannot be
            explored if the stimulus tested is limited exclusively to western
            classical music, so additional types of music and sounds from other
            cultures must be tested.
          </p>
          <b>Background:</b>
          <p>
            Synesthesia describes a rare neurological phenomenon in which a
            specific stimulus, which may be sensory, like a sound or flavor, or
            cognitive, such as a word or number, arouses a non-externally
            stimulated sensation. For example, an individual with chromesthesia
            might see the color red every time they hear the musical note C#.
            One important characteristic that distinguishes synesthesia from
            everyday associations is that the synesthetic pairing of two stimuli
            is involuntary, automatic, and non-suppressible. Synesthetic
            pairings are also highly consistent throughout the synesthete’s
            lifespan and remain unchanged from early childhood. Most
            interestingly, synesthesia is idiosyncratic, meaning that it
            manifests itself in a unique way for each person that has it. For
            example, while Person 1 may see red when they hear C#, Person 2
            might always see yellow instead. Many other forms of synesthesia
            have been discovered; estimates of the number of different forms of
            synesthesia range anywhere from 65 to over 150.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only recently has a more standardized battery of tests for
            synesthesia been developed, and these are only for the most common
            types: grapheme-color, or associating letters and numbers with
            color, and chromesthesia, when a musical stimulus such as a tone
            elicits a color sensation. Most of these tests present the letter or
            tone stimulus and have participants use a color wheel to describe
            the evoked sensation, and then the reflex speed and consistency of
            the responses over multiple tests is examined. The idea behind
            testing the speed of the response is that if the evoked sensation is
            truly involuntary, the participant will be quicker at selecting a
            color than if they needed to actually think and consciously make the
            association. These tests, along with
          </p>
          <b>Supporting Arguments/Analysis:</b>
          <p>
            In order to study synesthesia, we cannot restrict ourselves to
            categorical and quantitative measures that are grapheme-based and
            sound-based. There are so many types of synesthetes, with each type
            being idiosyncratic in nature. This idiosyncrasy is seen within our
            interviewee pool; despite all having chromesthesia, one particular
            individual had pairings for color, sound, and taste in addition to
            the standard color and sound. There is an urgent need for developing
            tests for the other forms of synesthesia, such as lexical-gustatory
            synesthesia [1] and mirror-touch synesthesia [2], among others. To
            better identify these different types of synesthesia, a broad range
            of tests that are not limited to reaction time should be considered.
            Reaction time components in current test batteries should be
            retained in order to test for the involuntary component of
            synesthesia, but a broader set of tests including a range of touch,
            taste, and olfactory stimuli should be used. This would allow
            researchers to both account for idiosyncrasies and maintain a
            systematic method of evaluating synesthesia.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specifically regarding chromesthesia and other sound-based types of
            synesthesia, the vast majority of current tests utilize western
            music in testing. This leads to questions as to whether the effects
            observed are informed by learning and culture. Among our
            interviewees, who were themselves classically trained musicians, it
            can be observed that their synesthetic pairing of color and sound
            does not occur for background noise or even naturalistic sounds.
            Instead, the effect seems to be particularly strong for music. This
            implies that there is an element of learning involved in this
            observed phenomenon. To better parse this learning effect, testing
            synesthetes from other musical cultures using western musical
            conventions, and testing western classical musicians using other
            musical systems should be considered.
